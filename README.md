# Hi, I'm Juciley Costa! 👋


# 🚀 About me
Backend developer with over 10 years of experience in IT. In addition to mastering the Java ecosystem, Azure DevOps, and RESTful WebServices using Spring Boot, which allows me to create robust, scalable, and integrated applications, I'm always looking for challenges, knowledge sharing, and new experiences. Currently, I'm seeking something disruptive, which is why I'm venturing into Web3 | Blockchain.

🧠 Learning and building my Web3/Blockchain portfolio daily.

🤔 Exploring new technologies and developing software solutions (Solidity, Chainlink, Besu(focus on DREX) and Java).

💻 Looking to collaborate and share all my acquired knowledge.

🏃‍♂️ In my free time, I enjoy road running/athletics.
